# Operating-Systems

A project for the course "Operating Systems", Presented in University of Tehran.

The objective of this project is to simulate one of the core algorithms of operating system in C++ programming language.
This simulation has a statistical approach where we analyze the result and see how changing different parameters would affect the result.
The chosen algorithm for this study is FCFS (First Come, First Serve) algorithm which is a CPU scheduling algorithm.
First, we will review some general concepts and requirements for our work. We will also compare CPU scheduling algorithms 
and see some pros and cons of each and mention which algorithm is more suitable for a certain process.
